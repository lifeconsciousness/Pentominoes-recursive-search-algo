PROJECT TITLE: PENTOMINOES
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The goal of this project is to implement a more efficient algorithm for placing all pentominoes on a board to maximise space utilisation. This is useful to know in real-life situations for example, making use of as much free space as possible in shipping container loading to be cost-effective.
VERSION or DATE: October 9 2023
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Begin by looking at the given code template and understanding parts of the code. Next fill in the code that shows the missing pentominoes in PentominoBuilder.java. Then check if a rectangle fill is a possible solution in Search.java. Check if there are any duplicate rotations of each of the pentominoes. Since the goal is to fit all the pentominoes on one rectangular board, we have to find an efficient algorithm to solve this by itself. Therefore, we should implement different algorithms and test each algorithm with different inputs and then use the most efficient algorithm. In summary, at the end of phase 1 we should have one working basic search algorithm and one working branching algorithm.
